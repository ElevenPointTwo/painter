# Name: Kevin D
# Purpose: A basic paint program that allows you to draw pictures, shapes, and save & open images.

# Challenges
# 1. Circles would overlap onto the background instead of staying on the canvas
# - Redraws a frame around the canvas everytime so that the paint doesn't leak out
# 2. Couldn't figure out how to make a bunch of buttons using "clean" code
# - Used two aligned lists for the rects and their colours
# - Struggled a while with dictionaries, talk about that
# 3. Don't name your own functions after a library, like random... do something like random_colours instead.
# 4. Saved images weren't jpgs
# - https://github.com/search?q=pygame.image.save&type=Code&l=Python (Examples via pygame documentation)
# 5. Tool selection
# - So essentially the issue came from the order of the functions called. Let's say I called paintbrush tool first
# and I click on the rectangle tool to change it. Well, since I called paintbrush tool first, when IT is checking the
# draw mode, draw_mode still == PAINT. Therefore it'll draw the outline, as it should. But then the signal reaches
# rect tool AFTERWARDS and turns draw_mode into rect, but it's too late because the outline was already drawn around
# the brush tool. It would require another click for the paint tool to actually update.
# - Solution? Create a separate function to check state first before drawing
# 6. Talk about how got inspiration for colour squares from sprite sheet code, the mod part

# Controls!
# - Click and hold on canvas to paint, or draw shapes depending on the tool selected. Use right click to erase.
# - Click the icons on the right side to change tools
# - Left clicking on the colour palette will change brush colour, right clicking will change background colour. Same for random.
# - The current brush colour and size are displayed at the bottom right
# - To save an image, click the floppy disk icon on the top right and enter the desired file name in the prompt in the console
#   - You can save a new image or update an existing one.
# - To open a saved image, click the folder icon on the top right and enter the file name into the prompt
